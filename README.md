Sudoku Game – Web-Based Puzzle App

This is a fully functional web-based Sudoku game that allows players to generate and solve puzzles of varying difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard). The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🔹 Features:
-> Dynamic Puzzle Generator: Randomly creates solvable Sudoku boards with difficulty settings based on how many cells are hidden.

-> Interactive UI: Clickable 9x9 grid where users can enter numbers or erase entries.

-> Difficulty Selection: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes before starting a new game.

-> Real-Time Validation: Automatically highlights incorrect entries.

-> Timer: Tracks how long you take to solve the puzzle.

-> Auto Solver: Solve the puzzle instantly with a single click.

-> Responsive Design: Looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
=> HTML: Basic structure of the page and game layout.

=> CSS: Styling for the board, buttons, and responsive design.

=> JavaScript: Logic for puzzle generation, solving via backtracking, user interaction, and game state management.

This project is a great demonstration of DOM manipulation, event handling, algorithms (especially backtracking for solving Sudoku), and UI/UX design.
